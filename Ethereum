Bitcoin is decentralised but not scalable. Vitalik created Ethereum Layer 1 infrastrcture in 2013 to address this problem. 
However, Ethereum is not as decentralized. It doesn't pass the purests' test but it addressed the application needs at the time. Majority of ICOs from 2015/6 - 2018 were built on ERC20
Arguably today ERC20 has lost its relavence as L1 due to its performance but because of all the legacy projects and the reconition in the market, Ether has become an asset second to Bitcoin. 
ERC20 has also become the IBM of Web3 - no corporate decision leaders ever get fired for hiring IBM.
